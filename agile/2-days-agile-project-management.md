# 2 Days Agile Project Management

## Course Description

Too many teams regard planning as something to be avoided, and too many organizations view plans as something to hold against their development teams. Even so, planning is a key part of all projects, even agile ones. This workshop explores the common reasons why traditional planning approaches fail and introduces practices that really do work.

In this two-days class, discover ways to break the cycle of planning failure and learn how to create reliable plans for improved decision making. Participants leave with a solid understanding of, and experience in, agile release and iteration planning. Multiple approaches to estimating, including unit-less points and ideal time are demonstrated. Participants also will be taught techniques for deriving estimates that can dramatically increase the chances of on-time completion.
